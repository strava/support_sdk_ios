# Zendesk Support SDK for iOS

This is a temporary repository used to suppress deprecation warnings until [Zendesk](https://github.com/zendesk/support_sdk_ios) makes an official [release](https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/classic-web-widget-sdks/support-sdk/ios/release_notes/). 

The `#frameworks-and-tools` team is leading this effort in order to enable our guild to upgrade to Xcode 26, and we are working closely with our Zendesk Partners to expedite an official release. We have put up a [PR](https://github.com/zendesk/support_sdk_ios/pull/12) targetting their SDK and have received confirmation they have seen it, but we're still waiting for it to be implemented.
